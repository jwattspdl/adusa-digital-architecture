# [ADR]

[The purpose of these documents is capture the decisions, choices made during the development of this service. 
Have you ever looked at a system and asked, why is it this way? These are the documents to answer those kinds of 
questions.]

[A template for the contents of these files is provided below, but these documents do not have to be written
in a formal tone. If the reasons for a decision is non-technical, e.g., organizational, go ahead and include it. ]

[The reasons behind every design decision do not have to be captured, but the team should capture the ones that are 
important to the architecture of the service. Examples:]

- Date time handling decisions, e.g., (does the application assume central or east time zone)
- Choice of the datastore, e.g., (why did we choose to use a relational database over a NoSQL database for this service)
- Reasons for or logic behind any oddities (hacks) in the design (albeit there shouldn't be any of these, but they happen)

[And follow [this template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-jeff-tyree-and-art-akerman)
for the contents of the ADRs.]
